## Major Developments
2000 BC: Mathematics develops in Babylonia
1700 BC: Pythagorean triples (a, b, c ; a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>), systems of linear equations, quadratic equations, geometry (area, volume, Ï€)
300 BC - 200 AD: Major Greek progress, followed by progress in Iran, Syria, India (which preserved Greek progress)
1000 AD: Adelard of Bath and then Fibonacci brought Islamic math progress to Europe
1500 AD: Major European progress with Pacioli, then Cardan, then Tartaglia/Ferrari (algebraic solution of cubic/quartic equations). Copernicus, Galileo revolutionized application of math to study universe
1600 AD: Calculus! Briggs discovered logarithms, Descartes uses algebraic methods for geometry, Fermat/Pascal studied probability, Newton used calculus as a tool to show interaction between math/physics/astronomy and developed theories of gravity and light. Leibniz's approach to calculus was more influential.
1700 AD: Euler invented calculus of variations and differential geometry and further researched number theory. ==Lagrange worked on functions/mechanics==, Laplace works on celestial mechanics.
1800 AD: Rapid progress. Fourier worked on heat, Riemann characterized geometry, Gauss (goat?) revolutionized differential geometry and contributed to astronomy and magnetism, Cauchy built on Langrage's work and studied functions of a complex variable,  Caley/Hamilton/Grassman worked on linear algebra, Cantor invented set theory.


Napier invented the basic concept of a calculator at the same time as logarithms. Once the pocket calculator was invented, logarithms (log tables) were no longer used for calculation. What will replace the calculator? What is something as different from the calculator as the calculator is from log tables?

Thoughts: Article was written in 1997, so author was likely thinking of some application of AI/ML, like NLP or similar. Maybe the next thing, after AI, is Quantum Computing... I would like to learn more about Quantum Computing.
