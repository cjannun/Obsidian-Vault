## Major Developments
2000 BC: Mathematics develops in Babylonia
1700 BC: Pythagorean triples (a, b, c ; a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>), systems of linear equations, quadratic equations, geometry (area, volume, Ï€)
300 BC - 200 AD: Major Greek progress, followed by progress in Iran, Syria, India (which preserved Greek progress)
1000 AD: Adelard of Bath and then Fibonacci brought Islamic math progress to Europe
1500 AD: Major European progress with Pacioli, then Cardan, then Tartaglia/Ferrari (algebraic solution of cubic/quartic equations). Copernicus, Galileo revolutionized application of math to study universe
1600 AD: Calculus! Briggs discovered logarithms, Descartes uses algebraic methods for geometry, Fermat/Pascal studied probability, Newton used calculus as a tool to show interaction between math/physics/astronomy and developed theories of gravity and light. Leibniz's approach to calculus was more influential.
1700 AD: Euler invented calculus of variations and differential geometry and further researched number theory. ==Lagrange worked on functions/mechanics==, Laplace works on celestial mechanics.
1800 AD: Rapid progress. Fourier worked on heat, Riemann characterized geometry, Gauss (goat?) revolutionized differential geometry and contributed to astronomy and magnetism, Cauchy built on Langrage's work and studied functions of a complex variable,  Caley/Hamilton/Grassman worked on linear algebra, Cantor invented set theory.
